### What is this?

POC Scraper for BBC Sounds. Pulls out show tracklists and creates spotify playlists (developer account required). It's a scraper, so it's going to be quite brittle.

### How does it work?

Uses XPath to extract show URLS from the page in config. Then we pull those pages and extract a JSON object from a `<script>` tag on those pages which, with a bit of string manipulation, can be parsed into a JSON object rich in show data. It's from this that we can extract tracklists.

That data is stored in a file called latest.json so you can run `index.js` using that rather than re-scraping. Be a nice citizen and also try not to get yourself bot-blocked (I assume BBC employs some bot-blocking).

Then the show data is uploaded to spotify (if the show playlist doesn't already exist).

I made this because I really like Benji B's show, but they only keep up the last 5 episodes, so I can keep show tracklists for posterity and also get great songs into my spotify liked list â™¥.

### How to run (Docker)

make an `auth.json` file in the project root, e.g.

```
{
    "clientId": "from-your-spotify-app",
    "clientSecret": "from-your-spotify-app",
    "redirectUri": "https://localhost/callback"
}
```

And change the config file to a show of your liking (this hasn't been tested yet on anything but the show in there)

Build the image:

```
docker build -t benji .
```

and then run the following command:

```
docker run -t benji npx run-func ./app/spotify/auth.js printAuthorizeUrl
```

copy the URL output in terminal and open in your browser. It will redirect you to a non-existant page on localhost (or whatever you configure as your callback URL) - that doesn't matter. Extract the `code` from the URL in the address bar. Then, no longer than a few minutes after your command above, run:

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/app -t benji npx run-func ./app/spotify/auth.js initialiseAuthorisation <code-from-last-command>
```

**Note**: in these commands you'll see `-v $(pwd):/app` which mounts the current folder to the docker container. When the app is running in docker, and it alters the `auth.json` file, having the mount means the changes to the files are reflected on your file system (rather than just changing only in the docker container).

You should now have everything (5 things) you need in `auth.json`. The App will use this to authenticate. Check everything is working OK by running:

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/app -t benji npx run-func ./app/spotify/auth.js init
```

To run the application and create playlists for real, run:

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/app -t benji npm run tasks
```
